    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a high school student interested in computer science, infosec, music, guitar, and philosophy. I
        plan on studying at the University of Nevada, Reno (I am currently a high school senior) and graduating with a BA in Computer Science & Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm especially interested in low-level computing, operation system design, and lower level languages like C and Rust. I also have an interest
        in cryptography, and more specifically, how it can influence privacy in an increasingly technological and less private society.

    <h1>about this site</h1>
    <p>
        I initially wrote this site using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, but I found it to be highly bloated and 
        not very convenient to use, so I decided to start fresh using just basic HTML and CSS, 
        No JavaScript or any other nonsense. This site is super minimalistic, and that's
        by choice. There isn't a point of trying to make a site like this look like more than it 
        really is. The code for the site is available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nan60/nan60.srht.site">here</a>, and is licensed under the GPL 3.</p>

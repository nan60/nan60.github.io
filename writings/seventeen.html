    <h1>Seventeen</h1>
    Seventeen. For most, it is just a number. For me, it was a realization. A realization that my sheltered, carefully overseen childhood had come to an end. With every year that had passed in my life, I knew that the inevitable time of pretending to be mature and professional was more and more upon me, but now I’m just one year away. The older I get, the more I begin to see the holes in our seemingly perfectly crafted world. Typos and poor grammar become apparent in previously professional writing, Movies become a production with nothing more in mind than profit, and the dreamlike idea of Disneyland is replaced with that of poor business practices and stories of employee mistreatment. The veil of ignorance I have been wearing my entire life is beginning to slip. People I once saw as “cashiers” or “janitors” are now becoming known to me as people. People just like me. People working jobs they don’t like to survive, trapped in a system that ultimately accomplishes nothing. These people have their own passions, fears, relationships, and memories of Christmas, yet here they are, wasting their only chance at life, doing something they don’t want to do. 
    <br><br>As we get older, we replace this wonder with a counterfeit personality grounded in some abstract societal expectation that was conceived unto itself by those doing the very same thing. We have built ideas of “professionalism” and “maturity” in a venture to end any significant creativity or outside thinking that has not been killed by our education system. By the end, we are nothing more than a shell of our former selves, trying our best to be happy and find purpose in a world that ultimately strives for the opposite, wanting to create robots with no emotion or expression in the pursuit of “profit” and “growth”. 
    <br><br>When I think about most people’s lifetime accomplishments, there is shockingly little. They went to school, worked, retired, and died. That's it. There is no happy ending or big idea. Living an entire life and ultimately accomplishing nothing is a horrifying thought. Is the system to blame for this, or are humans ultimately destined not to make a difference? No other animals seemingly have this conundrum. Their entire purpose is to eat, sleep, reproduce, and die, only for the cycle to repeat itself again. Have our systems changed this for humanity, or do we naturally long for purpose? Did early humans struggle to find a purpose prior to the formation of civilization and its rapid advancement, or were we simply content with survival?
    <br><br>Frankly, I’m afraid of this next chapter. The unforgiving, apathetic world is out there waiting for me with a grin on its face and I’m terrified of writing another one of these when I’m 85 years old, reflecting on my life, and coming to the realization that it's only half of a page long.

    <h1>Silence: A Time Without Power</h1>
       It's New Years Eve. Outside, A massive snowstorm was brewing outside my bedroom window, and though it was 2 o'clock, about the time I would usually wake up on winter break, 
       the weather outside seemed gloomy. The day was normal, aside from the slight pressure that would be put onto all of us as the time of the festivities for the new year approached. 
       I rolled over and took my phone from my bedside table and checked my plethora of apps before going to YouTube and watching random videos until the time I felt I should get up and walk to my computer, 
       which was located all the way across my bedroom. I was in the midst of this routine, one which I had been following arduously for the last couple of weeks, when something odd happened. The power had gone out. 
       At first, I didn't mind, it just meant that I would spend another hour or so in bed. But eventually, about 20 minutes after the power went out, so did my phone's data. I now had almost no real connection to the outside world.<br><br> 
       It was just me, my brother, and my mom. I decided to leave my room for the first time that day. Outside my bedroom, I had noticed my mom had already lit some candles and we were in it for the long haul. 
       It was getting dark by this time, and it was almost to the time where, without light, we would be unable to see. It was the midst of winter, and it was getting cold. My brother decided to huddle 
       under a blanket, my mom did the same, While I found something to eat and something to distract myself from darkness. It was seemingly endless complaining from everyone, about how much this sucked 
       and how much we all wanted it to just be over, me included. By this time, it was clear that due to the power outage and the massive snowstorm outside, the new year's festivities had been cancelled. 
       The pressure was off, and I was able to just live in the moment. I sat there, on the rug that sits on the hardwood flooring of my living room, where I listened.  
       I listened closer than I swore I ever had before, and even so; I heard nothing. Nothing. No refrigerator buzz or TV speakers. No buzz from the lights or sounds from the people of my household carrying out their daily tasks. 
       It was quieter than I've ever heard anything in my life, to the point where I swore, I could hear my own heart beating.<br><br>
       It was completely dark outside by this point and I eventually got up from where I was sitting in the living room and looked out the window. 
       Out there was nothing either. It was the visual representation of what I had heard in my ears moments ago, as if I had some strange form of synesthesia. 
       Outside, snow was falling at a rapid pace and a thick white coating had coated the streets and yards of my neighbors. There was darkness where the bright streetlight next to my house usually glows. 
       The houses of my neighbors were devoid of any life.  The Christmas lights that were usually shining vibrantly, now devoid of any color at all.
       I looked and listened, making the realization that so much of life, were these lights, and these sounds. Things we think we need, but without them, the world is a better, simpler place.
       I continued thinking about this idea for a little while before the power eventually came back on. While I was obviously relived, part of me longed for that silence again.
       Simply to look out the window and watch the snow fall in the darkness, for just a little while longer.

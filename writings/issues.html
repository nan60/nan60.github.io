    <h1>Issues in Education</h1>
    Our current grading approach is deeply flawed. It is a broken system that highlights those with good support groups, those with money, and those who have the time and energy to invest themselves in school. School now emphasizes information that has little real substance and relates in exceedingly insignificant amounts to the real world. Classes like math, science, and English are all important but lack proper substance or information to keep students interested.
	<br><br>Public schooling was conceived in the times of the industrial revolution to prepare students to work in factories, which is not a problem unto itself until you realize that nothing about school has changed since then. We have evolved as a society and as a culture of this time, and school has gotten increasingly diverse and technological. The only things that fail to get with the times are the classes, grading system, and subjects we learn. We are increasingly forced into learning near-useless knowledge and are forced to then vomit it all up on a test, before eventually forgetting it. Modern education increasingly has forgotten it's main purpose, that is, to learn. It has instead become a metric for how well someone can memorize, and how well they can pay attention to information they don’t care about. 
    <br><br>School is missing a level of personalization and care that is creating a ripple between students and the system. A ripple that is being thrown up to laziness and decreased attention spans. When the ripple was simply caused by youth learning more about the world, and how much there is to do in it. When presented with this information, instead of learning more about their interests, they are instead forced to sit in a room and learn information they couldn’t care less about. That is the main conflict. Now that the entire world's information is in our pocket, a Google search away, information that is taught in schools is becoming increasingly useless, or at the very least, much simpler to obtain. 
    <br><br>One presented solution is something known as standard-based grading. This system puts all the emphasis on tests, essentially making all assignments optional, as well as homework. This approach could work very well for certain students, such as those that prefer to learn on their own, and especially those that already know the material and just want to easily get into an advanced course (Knight and Cooper, 2019). On the other hand, It has been shown that standard-based grading does the opposite. Increasing the stress of students and reducing their self-esteem, especially in girls (Högberg et al., 2019), and certain types of exams, namely multiple choice, can hinder critical thinking (Stanger-Hall, 2012)
    <br><br>Another potential solution would just be to abolish grades altogether. While this seems like it could be a good idea, it would cause more issues than our current system. As it stands, grades have been proven to be a huge motivating factor for performance and effort in our education system (Pulfrey et al., 2011).
    <br><br>Instead, the better solution would be to not test at all, at least in the conventional sense. Instead, gauge knowledge based on practical assessments. For example, in a computer science class, students can write a program that meets certain minimum requirements, or in an English class, emphasize the creative side of the writing process, instead of focusing so much on grammar rules, vocabulary, and analyzing the same books over and over again. These applied skills will not only keep the students more interested in the subject at hand, but it will also allow them to learn more, naturally, sometimes out of necessity for what they’re writing. For example, in an open-ended computer science project, I couldn’t figure out how to do a task efficiently, and after some research, found out about a feature of the language I didn’t even know existed. This gave me experience and taught me something new.
    <br><br>This approach is similar to that of standard-based grading system except that tests are replaced with creative assignments that apply the knowledge in an open-ended student-driven way. A common grievance is that this approach makes it difficult to gauge knowledge of students compared to each other, which is true. What this problem declines to mention is that the system of comparing two students' work to one another is a deeply flawed approach. It strictly sees which students are gifted in the approach the instructor has elected to use. An open-ended approach, while making it more difficult to compare students’ work, allows all students to express themselves and their knowledge the way that they see fit. The approach of turning students into robots to do the same work over and over is deeply flawed, flavorless, and allows students to have nearly no real say in their work, which is not how the real world operates. The real world operates with the principle of “get it done, ASAP, don't care how”. This approach should be echoed in school, with the philosophy that your skills are what you were hired for, not just to follow instructions exactly, with no real contribution aside from actually doing the work. There's an argument to be made that this is the philosophy of a newly birthed industrialized world, but that's changed now. Some jobs involve following instructions exactly, but these jobs are typically undesirable and underpaid. Real money and careers come from jobs where you bring something to the table, as opposed to being a mindless zombie with a college degree.
    <br><br>In the end, our deeply flawed education system needs fixing, and it's up to our government to institute a new, modern, and personalized education system that emphasizes applying skills more than just learning them, testing them and then moving on to the next unit.
